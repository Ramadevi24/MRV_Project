//q:what is reactjs and how to use it?
//a:React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component subclasses:

write a JavaScript function to display the current day and time in the following format.
// Sample Output : Today is : Tuesday.
// Current time is : 10 PM : 30 : 38

function displayDateTime() {
    let today = new Date();
    let day = today.getDay();
    let dayList = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
    let hour = today.getHours();
    let minute = today.getMinutes();
    let second = today.getSeconds();
    let prepand = (hour >= 12) ? " PM " : " AM ";
    hour = (hour >= 12) ? hour - 12 : hour;
    if (hour === 0 && prepand === ' PM ') {
        if (minute === 0 && second === 0) {
            hour = 12;
            prepand = ' Noon';
        } else {
            hour = 12;
            prepand = ' PM';
        }
    }
    if (hour === 0 && prepand === ' AM ') {
        if (minute === 0 && second === 0) {
            hour = 12;
            prepand = ' Midnight';
        } else {
            hour = 12;
            prepand = ' AM';
        }
    }
    console.log("Today is : " + dayList[day] + ".");
    console.log("Current time is : " + hour + prepand + " : " + minute + " : " + second);
}
